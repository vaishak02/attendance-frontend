# This is the frontend of the project 'Attendance System using Facial Recognition'

## This is the first draft. Quite a few things are still missing

- Navbar Created.
- Login functionality somewhat working. Credentials are hardcoded.
- Sign In forms created, but no functionality to create user.

### Need to create

- Student list table, where you can add, delete and edit students.
- Editable user Profile.
- Page to initiate attendance taking.
- Need to generate resultant excel sheet.
